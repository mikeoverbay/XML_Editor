<p><strong>General Help.</strong></p>
<p>To change the colors, click the one you want to change FIRST<br>
  and than, pick the color on the right.<br>
  The Editor will remember your color scheme and will<br>
  be setup the next time you load the app.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>BACK UP</strong> before using this tool. Overwriting an XML with<br>
  bad code can ruin your game and you may need to download<br>
  the entire thing again. NOT a good thing!!<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br>
Use at your one risk. If you break your game with this tool,<br>
  It is NOT my fault.</p>
<p>The text box will only work with mono spaced fonts.<br>
That is why the list is short when you try to change them.<br>
It does however, do syntax highlighing and very fast. </p>
<p>The World of Tank XML has a non-standard XML format.<br>
  This app will display it correctly because I spend 2 days<br>
figuring out how to deal with the bogus property items.</p>
<p>There is a file in the installed folder( filtered_strings.txt ) that contains a list<br>
  of all these property entries (That I have found so far).<br>
  If the XML display badly, look for what's after the<br>
  &lt;property&gt; line(s) and add that text to the filtered_strings.txt<br>
file. In order to display the XML correctly, these odd entries<br>
must be wrapped in a temp tag before formatting and after,<br>
the temp tags are removed. Its the only way I could make the<br>
XML display correctly.<br>
<br>
This app uses a fantastic syntax highlighting control by <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=1005558" rel="author"><span itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name">Pavel Torgashov</span></span></a>.<br>
